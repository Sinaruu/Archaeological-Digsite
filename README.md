# Archaeological Digsite

In this game, you need to find all artifacts in the field specified **by you**. If you find a greater artifact, you receive **two points**; if you find a lesser artifact, you will only receive **one point**. Before the game starts, you specify how big the field is and how many artifacts will be generated. There is no time limit or maximum digs allowed per round.

**Fully written in C and uses memory allocation and 2D arrays using pointers.**
